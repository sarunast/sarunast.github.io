    Originally, I am from Lithuania. I have always been interested in different
    kinds of media - creating, editing, and sharing it. When I was still in
    school, during the summer holidays, I would come up with interesting project
    ideas. One of them was to build a website. I got a simple book on how to
    build websites and slowly started learning. Funny enough, it was so
    interesting to me that I went to the UK to study Web Development & Design.

  <h3>What am I doing now ?</h3>
  <p>
    Currently, I am living in ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland and working for
    <a href="https://smallpdf.com/" rel="noreferrer">smallpdf.com</a>. I mainly
    focus on Frontend. On a daily basis, I mostly work with
    <strong>React</strong>.

    Besides learning and experimenting with new frameworks and technologies I
    enjoy hiking and taking pictures. If you want to see my recent shots you can
    easily find them on
